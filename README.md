# 🖋️ AirDraw: Because Pens Are Overrated  

So, you've finally had enough of good old pen and paper? Welcome to **AirDraw**, where we turn your flailing hand gestures into actual digital scribbles. No, this isn’t a magic trick—it’s just some good ol' computer vision and a sprinkle of modern tech.  

## 🚀 What is AirDraw?  
AirDraw is an intuitive, fun, and slightly ridiculous hand-tracking tool that lets you write or draw on a digital canvas without actually touching anything. Yep, it's **invisible ink for the 21st century**.   

## 🛠️ Features (Because We Know You Need Convincing)  
✅ **Write in thin air** – because pens are just tiny swords of ink.  
✅ **Color selection** – unleash your inner Picasso (but with fingers).  
✅ **Hand tracking** – your webcam finally has a purpose other than Zoom calls.  
✅ **Real-time drawing** – no delays, just pure unfiltered hand-powered chaos.  
✅ **Eraser mode? Nah, just clear the whole thing!**  

## 🤖 How It Works?  
1. Wave at your webcam (like you’re summoning a genie).  
2. Move your index finger—watch in awe as it starts drawing.  
3. Select colors by pointing at the buttons on the screen (precision required, good luck).  
4. Want to clear everything? Just tap "CLEAR" and regret all your artistic choices.  
5. If things go south, restart—because debugging reality is still not an option.

## 📝Edit
- You must have Python Interpreter 3.10 to use MediaPipe.<br>
- I've included a video (Examine the bottom) to give you a sneak peek at my project before you install it.

## 📦 Installation (Because Nothing Good Comes Easy)  
1. **Make sure Python is installed** (or summon your friendly neighbourhood coder).  
2. Install dependencies with:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
3. Run the magic script:
    ```bash
    python AirDraw.py
4. Look into your webcam and question your life choices.


## 🎨 Pro Tips for Procrastinators
💡 Use dramatic hand gestures for a more artistic effect.
💡 If it's not working, check your webcam. Or just blame the code.
💡 AirDraw won’t make you an artist, but it will make you look cool.
